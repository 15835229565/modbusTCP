If a value is accessed in synchronous mode, the program will stop and wait for the slave to respond. If the slave does not answer within a specified time, a timeout exception is called. The class uses multi-threading for both synchronous and asynchronous access. The class opens two communication channels for each slave. This is necessary because the synchronous thread has to wait for a command to finish. This would block the asynchronous connection. The class directory contains a help file (ModbusClassTCP\\doc) with detailed information for every function.\r\n\r\nA sample application is included in the package that shows the basic features. It uses asynchronous mode for all function calls. The sample has some additional code to make the result handling more comfortable.\r\n\r\n## Points of Interest\r\nRemember that a lot of Modbus clients use a watchdog telegram to make sure the master is still active. If you donâ€™t call this watchdog within a specified time, the slave will close the connection. This feature is used to avoid unused open ports when the connection is interrupted.\r\n\r\n## History\r\nVersion 3.3 (6/14/2013)\r\n\r\n- Fixed: ID high and low byte swapped\r\n- Added: Modbus parameter UNIT added to function calls\r\n\r\nVersion 3.2\r\n\r\nFirst release","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
